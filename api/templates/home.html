      <h1>Introduction and Motivation</h1>
      <p>Our project aims to tackle the significant problem of medication non-adherence. It is a widespread issue that affects many people, especially 
        those with chronic conditions, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. Our solution is a smart medication dispenser that reminds users 
        when it's time to take their medication, thus increasing adherence to the medication regimen. To ensure that our dispenser is accessible to all 
        users, we employed a universal design approach, ensuring that it is usable by individuals with various physical abilities and for any type of 
        medication. We created a 3D printed prototype, which allowed 
        us to visualize the product better, identify design issues and refine the design to ensure that it met our specifications. The prototype also 
        helped us to test the functionality and usability of the dispenser, giving us valuable feedback on how to make it better.</p>

      <h1>Presentation Slides</h1>
      <p>Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NSFRPilgBTE9vqEnUrnWKUj5EXJcKe8hNcMQZVRRXVo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> to view our presentation slides.</p>

      <h1>Key Insights from Peer Feedback</h1>
      <p>Overall, it seems like our presentation was received positively by the audience. We did a good job introducing the problem and establishing our 
        target demographic. The 3D printed model was well done, and many people liked it. However, some people felt like our slides were too wordy and 
        could have been more concise. We also received feedback that we should have included more diverse groups of people in our consideration, such as 
        those with mobility issues or who take medications while out and about. Additionally, we could have improved the presentation by not reading off 
        of the slides as much and being more natural.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
      <p>Our project has a great real-world impact, especially for elderly patients. It is a universal design that could apply to everyone, but 
        we could still make it more accessible for people with mobility issues or who have to take medications while out and about. It is a 
        good idea, but it could be expanded upon in the future to differentiate between medication in the event of having to take multiple medicines at 
        the same time.
        
        We received positive feedback on our medication dispenser prototype, and we can continue to work on it in the future to 
        make it more accessible and improve its functionality. Future work could include differentiating between medication in the event of having to 
        take multiple medicines at the same time and making the dispenser more accessible for people with mobility issues or who have to take medications 
        while out and about. We could additionally create a mobile app to alert patients when they are not present.</p>
